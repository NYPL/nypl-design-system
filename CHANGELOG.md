## 1.6.0 (June 8, 2023)

### Vite Foundation Update

This updates replaces TSDX with Vite for the build tool. This allows the Reservoir DS library to be easily maintained and allow individual npm packages to be updated for security patches and general bug fixes. At the same time, the local and production build process are now much faster. Specific updates and changes:

- Node 16 is the recommended version to use and it is set in the `.nvmrc` file.
- Github Actions are updated to use Node 16. The Typecheck workflow is removed since that's covered by the build script. Using Node 16 also allows the Vercel deployments to work without the the added `NODE_OPTIONS` flag in the npm build script.
- Vite is used to build the library and start a development build.
- Rollup plugins are removed in favor of Vite plugins.
- Gulp and the `resources.scss` file are removed. Other related `.scss` files were also removed since they are not used (in the library or in consuming applications).
- ESLint packages are updated.
- Jest is updated along with its config file. `jest-environment-jsom` and `ts-jest` are used now. Snapshot test output files have _slightly_ different rendered HTML syntax.
- The build is _still_ outputting CommonJS and ES module dist files, but the final name is slightly different. This does not affect how the DS is imported into any application.
- Due to moving to ESM as the default for the repo, types are exported separated from components in the main `/src/index.ts` file. This doesn't affect the final build but just how components, interfaces, and types are exported.
- Storybook is updated to 7.0.18 which is a major version.
- All Storybook component documentation have been updated to use the Storybook 7 CSF format, along with MDX for the custom documentation pages.

### Adds

- Adds the `target` prop to the `Link` component.

### Removals

- Removes the `Header` and `Footer` components from the DS. These components will be moved and maintained in the [nypl-header-app](https://github.com/NYPL/nypl-header-app).

## 1.5.4 (May 4, 2023)

### Updates

- Updates the `Select` component to use a set text color value.

### Fixes

- Fixes the focus rectangle around the `TextInput` clear button so it is centered on both desktop and mobile views.

## 1.5.3 (April 28, 2023)

### Adds

- Adds `ui.gray.semi-medium` and `ui.gray.semi-dark` to the color palette.
- Adds `Audio and Video` page to the `Accessibility Guide` section of Storybook.
- Adds "Pinterest" and "SoundCloud" options to the `Icon` component.

### Updates

- Updates the `Link` component to include the rel attributes "noopener" and "noreferrer" on the "external" variant.
- Updates the `dark.ui.border.default` design token to use `ui.gray.semi-dark` as its base.
- Updates the `dark.ui.border.hover` design token to use `ui.gray.semi-medium` as its base.
- Updates the `dark.ui.disabled.primary` design token to use `ui.gray.dark` as its base.
- Updates the `dark.ui.disabled.secondary` design token to use `ui.gray.x-dark` as its base.
- Updates the `Toggle` component to use `ui.gray.semi-dark` color for its background color.
- Updates the `List` and `StyledList` components to use `ui.gray.semi-dark` for the bullet color in the "ul" variant.
- Updates the `Slider` component to use `ui.bg.active` for the color of the track bar in the "disabled" state.
- Updates the `Breadcrumbs` component so that the last breadcrumb item is now a link. If the link text is too long, it will get truncated and the DS `Tooltip` component will be used to display the full text in a tooltip when the text is hovered.

### Fixes

- Fixes a `border-radius` formatting issues on the hover state of the search field for the dark mode version of the `Header` component.
- Fixes a `color` issue on the hover state of the links for the dark mode version of the `Footer` component.
- Fixes a `border-color` issue for the dark mode version of the `FeedbackBox` component.
- Fixes a bug in `TextInput` that prevented the external clearing of `value`.

## 1.5.2 (April 6, 2023)

### Updates

- Updates the `SearchBar` component to include `defaultValue` as a prop in `textInputProps`.

### Removes

- Removes the `Color Mode` docs page from Storybook due to the addition of the `Supporting Dark Mode` docs page.

### Fixes

- Removes the `Slider` component's internal state update function (`setCurrentValue`) from Chakra's own `RangeSlider` component's `onChangeEnd` prop function. This fixes an issue where both Chakra's `onChange` and `onChangeEnd` prop functions were being called regardless of whether they were passed to the DS `Slider` component or not. Since Chakra's `onChange` function will always be called, the internal state function is kept. This ensures that there is no multiple calls or loop of state update calls when using keyboard controls to change the range slider's value.

## 1.5.0 (March 16, 2023)

- Adds `brand` as a `breadcrumbsType` to the `Breadcrumbs` component.

The update in the `ComponentWrapper` component affects the `AudioPlayer`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `SearchBar`, `Select`, `Slider`, `TextInput`, `Toggle`, and `VideoPlayer` DS components, each of which render helper or error text.
- Updates the `MultiSelect` component so it closes when the "escape" key is pressed.
- Updates where the focus is set in the `MultiSelect` "dialog" variant after the "Apply" button is clicked.

- Updates the `Heading` component to use the DS `Link` component rather than Chakra's `Link` component.
- Updates the style of links rendered in the `Heading` component so they are styled as standard links. The only exception is for links used in the `Card` component for the _full-click functionality_ feature. Otherwise, links in `Card` headings are styled as standard links.
- Updates the `SearchBar` component to now be implemented with the `ComponentWrapper` component.
- Removes the `ButtonTypes.SearchBar` variant style for the `Button` component. The style object is now set and passed directly to the `Button` component in the `SearchBar` component through the `additionalStyles` prop.
- Renames `additionalStyles` prop to `additionalWrapperStyles` in the `Image` Component.

### Fixes

- Fixes the styling of custom anchor elements when passed as a child in the `Link` component.
- Allows the `TemplateAppContainer` and `TemplateFooter` components to use the `renderFooterElement` prop. This is `true` by default so it renders an HTML `footer` element. If a custom footer component that renders its own HTML `<footer>` must be used, then setting `renderFooterElement` to false will not render two nested `footer` elements.
- Fixes the Storybook `level` prop value for the `Heading` component so it updates the component.
- Removes wrapper divs around custom image elements used in the `Card` component. Also passes the aspect ratio as `ImageRatios.Original` when the custom image element is passed to the `Card` component.

The "Required"/"Optional" text in the date range legend can now be hidden with the `showOptReqLabel` prop.
