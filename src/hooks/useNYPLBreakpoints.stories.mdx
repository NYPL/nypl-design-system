# useNYPLBreakpoints

| Hook Version | DS Version |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| Added        | `1.0.4`    |
| Latest       | `1.0.4`    |

This custom hook is inspired by Chakra's `useMediaQuery` hook. Internally,
the hook uses the `useMediaQuery` hook and the `MediaMatch` API to determine
the current breakpoint size based on NYPL's breakpoint configuration. In order
to follow responsive design patterns, the "min-width" media query is used
with the breakpoint configuration. The list of breakpoints can be found on
the [Reservoir's Breakpoints](https://nypl.github.io/nypl-design-system/reservoir/v1/?path=/story/style-guide-breakpoints--page)
style guide.

## Usage

The hook returns an object with four boolean values:

```tsx
const {
  isLargerThanSmall,
  isLargerThanMedium,
  isLargerThanLarge,
  isLargerThanXLarge,
} = useNYPLBreakpoints();
```

For the following example, we'll use the NYPL "medium" breakpoint value. The
"medium" breakpoint has a value of `"38em"` (or `"600px"`). If different
components need to be conditionally rendered based on the current size of the
viewport, we can use the `isLargerThanMedium` boolean value.

```tsx
const DesktopLayout = () => ...
const MobileLayout = () => ...

<Box>
  <Text>
    {isLargerThanMedium ? "Larger than medium" : "Smaller than medium"}
  </Text>
  {isLargerThanMedium ? <DesktopLayout /> : <MobileLayout />}
</Box>
```
