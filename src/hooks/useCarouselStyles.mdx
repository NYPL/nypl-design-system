| Latest       | `Prerelease` |

This custom hook, inspired by this [codesandbox example](https://codesandbox.io/s/fxjeo),
exposes functions used for carousel-like components that have sliding features.
The two main functions are `prevSlide` and `nextSlide` used for buttons to
navigate between slides, and a `carouselStyle` style object for the main wrapper
element. If the carousel should programmatically slide to the first slide, use
the `goToStart` function.

Note: This hook is currently not being used.
