# useNYPLBreakpoints

| Hook Version | DS Version   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| Added        | `1.0.4`      |
| Latest       | `Prerelease` |

This custom hook is inspired by Chakra's `useMediaQuery` hook. Internally, the
hook uses the `useMediaQuery` hook and the `MediaMatch` API to determine the
current breakpoint size based on NYPL's breakpoint configuration.

## Mobile-First

In order to follow mobile-first responsive design patterns, the "min-width"
media query is used with the breakpoint configuration. The list of breakpoints
can be found on the [Reservoir's
Breakpoints](../?path=/docs/style-guide-breakpoints--docs) style guide.

## Usage

The hook returns an object with a series of boolean values. Some of the values
adhere to the default Chakra syntax for breakpoints, while others use an NYPL
semantic naming convention.

<Source
  code={`
const {
  // Chakra syntax
  isLargerThanSmall,
  isLargerThanMedium,
  isLargerThanLarge,
  isLargerThanXLarge,
  
  // NYPL semantic syntax
  isLargerThanSmallMobile,
  isLargerThanLargeMobile,
  isLargerThanSmallTablet,
  isLargerThanLargeTablet,
  isLargerThanMobile,
  isLargerThanTablet,
} = useNYPLBreakpoints();
`}
  language="jsx"
/>

For the following example, we'll use the NYPL specific mobile breakpoint value.
This breakpoint value is based on the "medium" breakpoint value of `"48em"` (or
`"768px"`). If different components need to be conditionally rendered based on
the current size of the viewport, we can use the `isLargerThanMobile` boolean
value.

<Source
  code={`
const DesktopLayout = () => ...
const MobileLayout = () => ...
// ...
<Box>
  <Text>
    {isLargerThanMobile ? "Larger than mobile" : "Smaller than mobile"}
  </Text>
  {isLargerThanMobile ? <DesktopLayout /> : <MobileLayout />}
</Box>
`}
  language="jsx"
/>
