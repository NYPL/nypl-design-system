# NYPL Design System

## @nypl/design-system-react-components

Welcome to the New York Public Library's Design System React component library.
This design system is NYPLâ€™s open-source extensible React library for products
and experiences with accessibility as its foundation. It ships functional,
stateless components with consistent NYPL styling. You can learn more about the
project and its goals [here](https://confluence.nypl.org/display/DIGTL/NYPL+Design+System).

The best way to get started is through the [Design System's Wiki](https://github.com/NYPL/nypl-design-system/wiki)
to learn how about design and implementation at NYPL. The following Hero is just
one example of how we use the NYPL Design System on NYPL.org.

<Hero
  heroType={HeroTypes.FiftyFifty}
  subHeaderText="With 92 locations across the Bronx, Manhattan, and Staten Island, The New York Public Library is an essential part of neighborhoods across the city. Visit us today."
