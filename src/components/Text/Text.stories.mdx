## Overview

<Description of={Text} />

The `Text` component renders a basic `<p>` element. As its name indicates, the
`size` prop controls the size of the text rendered in the component.

          Animal Crossing[a] is a social simulation video game series developed
          and published by Nintendo. The series was conceptualized and created
          by Katsuya Eguchi and Hisashi Nogami. In Animal Crossing, the player
          character is a human who lives in a village inhabited by various
          anthropomorphic animals and can do various activities like fishing,
          bug catching, and fossil hunting. The series is notable for its
          open-ended gameplay and use of the video game console's internal clock
          and calendar to simulate real passage of time.

        <Text {...args} size={enumValues.getValue(args.size)}>
