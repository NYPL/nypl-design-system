          Animal Crossing[a] is a social simulation video game series developed
          and published by Nintendo. The series was conceptualized and created
          by Katsuya Eguchi and Hisashi Nogami. In Animal Crossing, the player
          character is a human who lives in a village inhabited by various
          anthropomorphic animals and can do various activities like fishing,
          bug catching, and fossil hunting. The series is notable for its
          open-ended gameplay and use of the video game console's internal clock
          and calendar to simulate real passage of time.

          3DS and Nintendo Switch. The series has been both critically and
          commercially successful and has sold over 60 million units worldwide.
          Three spin-off games have also been released: Animal Crossing: Happy
          Home Designer for Nintendo 3DS, Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival for
