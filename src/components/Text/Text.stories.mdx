          Animal Crossing[a] is a social simulation video game series developed
          and published by Nintendo. The series was conceptualized and created
          by Katsuya Eguchi and Hisashi Nogami. In Animal Crossing, the player
          character is a human who lives in a village inhabited by various
          anthropomorphic animals and can do various activities like fishing,
          bug catching, and fossil hunting. The series is notable for its
          open-ended gameplay and use of the video game console's internal clock
          and calendar to simulate real passage of time.
