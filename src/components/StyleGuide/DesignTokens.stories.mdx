## What are Design Tokens?

Design tokens are the style values that define a design system. These values
can include, but may not be limited to, spacing, color, typography, breakpoints
and object styles. Ultimately, these values are used to construct and maintain
the components that make up our system.

## Why Use Design Tokens?

_"With design tokens, you can capture low-level values and then use them to
create the styles for your product or app. You can maintain a scalable and
consistent visual system for UI development."_ - Jina Bolton, Lead Designer
for the Salesforce Design System

Design tokens are a single source of truth when it comes to styles. They allow
an organization to more easily build multiple applications - web and/or native -
that feel and look the same without slowing down the development team.

## How to Use the Reservoir Design Tokens

The NYPL design tokens are built into the Reservoir Design System (DS) and are
offered in two formats for consumption: CSS variables and javascript data
objects. To access either of these formats, the DS `v0.25.9` or higher needs
to be properly installed in a consuming React application.

## Using Reservoir Design Tokens in CSS

If your app uses CSS or SCSS to handle styles, the DS creates standard CSS
custom properties (e.g. variables) for consumption in your stylesheets. If the
DS is properly installed, the CSS custom properties will be available for you
to use. Nothing more needs to be done to your app.

To assist with CSS scope isolation, all of the CSS custom properties created
by the DS are prefixed with "nypl." Please see the examples below.

```css
--nypl-colors-brand-primary
--nypl-colors-brand-secondary
--nypl-fontSizes-sm
--nypl-fontSizes-md
--nypl-fontSizes-lg
--nypl-fontSizes-xl
--nypl-space-xxs
--nypl-space-xs
--nypl-space-s
--nypl-space-m
--nypl-space-l
```

The CSS custom properties are defined on the :root pseudo-class and should be
implemented using standard CSS custom properties conventions.

```css
/* Property Declaration in the DS */
:root {
  --nypl-colors-brand-primary: #c60917;
}

/* Property Usage in Your Application */
.custom-button {
  background: var(--nypl-colors-brand-primary);
}
```

## Using Reservoir Design Tokens in Javascript

If you would like to use CSS-in-JS styles in your React components, the
`useNYPLTheme` hook will provide you with Reservoir design token values. The hook
depends on the `DSProvider` component and will not work properly outside of
the `DSProvider` wrapper component.

After importing and implementing the `DSProvider` wrapper component, as
explained in the `DSProvider` section of the [DS Chakra UI](?path=/story/chakra-ui--page#dsprovider)
document, your children components can use this hook function.

```tsx
import { useNYPLTheme } from "@nypl/design-system-react-components";
const theme = useNYPLTheme();
```

The theme variable will be a javascript object containing the NYPL design
token style values. This will allow you to use design token values in your
components through CSS-in-JS.

```tsx
// theme
{
  breakpoints: { ... },
  colors: {
    brand: { ... },
    section: { ... },
    transparent: { ... },
    ui: { ... },
  },
  fontSizes: { ... },
  fontWeights: { ... },
  fonts: { ... },
  radii: { ... },
  space: { ... },
}
```

#### Using in DS Components

The general rule of thumb is that DS components and the available variants
should be used with the styles and variants as they are shown in Storybook,
but there may be rare times when a component does require a modification.
That said, if a DS component does need an updated style, first contact the
Design System and UX teams about this update.

If you receive approval to make a change in a consuming app, then you can add
styles directly as style props. For example, if the `Heading` component needs to
render text in Reservoir's "success primary" green color and add a bold font
weight, then you can do the following:

```tsx
const theme = useNYPLTheme();

// ...
return (
  <div>
    <Heading
      level={2}
      color={theme.colors.ui.success.primary}
      fontWeight={theme.fontWeights.bold}
    >
      Get a Digital Library Card Today in a Few Easy Steps
    </Heading>
  </div>
);
```

IMPORTANT: At the moment, not all DS components have this prop or feature.

#### Using in HTML Components

For styling standard HTML elements, use the `style` attribute to add inline styles.

```html
<p style={{ color: theme.colors.ui.success.primary }}>
  If you are 13 or older and live, work, attend school, or pay property
  taxes in New York State, you can get a free digital library card right
  now using this online form. Visitors to New York State can also use this
  form to apply for a temporary card.
</p>
```

#### Using in Styled Components

For adding theme styles to styled-objects, use the theme object as a standard javascript variable.

```tsx
const CustomButton = styled.button`
  background: ${theme.colors.brand.primary};
`;
```

## Reservoir Design Token Categories

The DS design tokens are broken into the following categories:

- [breakpoints](?path=/story/documentation-style-guide-breakpoints--page)
- [colors](?path=/story/documentation-style-guide-colors--page)
  - brand
  - section
  - transparent
  - ui
- radii
- [spacing](?path=/story/documentation-style-guide-spacing--page)
- [typography](?path=/story/documentation-style-guide-typography--page)
  - font families
  - font sizes
  - font weights

For details related to a specific category, please refer to the corresponding
section in the Style Guide available in the DS Storybook.
