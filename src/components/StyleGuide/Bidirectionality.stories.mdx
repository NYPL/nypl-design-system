# Bidirectionality

When building UIs, we think in terms of left to right for layout direction. This
is because the default language we build UIs for is English. At NYPL, we serve
patrons who speak a variety of languages including languages such as Arabic or
Hebrew which are right to left languages.

To correctly render these languages, UIs should be mirrored to accomodate navigation
and the passage of time, for example. Check out Material Design's
[Bidirectionality documentation](https://material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html)
for more information on layout mirroring.

## Terms

- LTR = left to right
- RTL = right to left

## Background

While the majority of applications at NYPL will have a LTR direction, some applications
will introduce internationalization through different means. While the Reservoir Design
System (DS) has _no preference_ in how an application is internationalized, DS
components should work appropriately in RTL configurations in any browser.

## Application Implementation

Components in the DS will support layout and component mirroring, but application
directionality should be implemented at the application level. The following are
general guidelines on how to set up directionality but implementation will be up
to the application and its architecture.

### `dir` HTML attribute

The `dir` HTML attribute can be added to elements to indicate its directionality.
The default direction is `"ltr"` or left to right. For languages, such as Arabic
or Hebrew, the correct direction is right to left and the proper attribute
implementation is `dir="rtl"`.

The placement of this attribute can be added at the root `<html>` element but can
also be placed in specific DOM elements within a page to target specific page sections.
For example, if you only want to target NYPL DS components within your top-level
`app` class, the `dir` attribute can be added to that element:

```jsx
<div className="app" dir="rtl">
  ...
</div>
```

An anti-pattern is to add `dir` to all the elements you want to change directionality
in. This HTML rule cascades down to its children elements so there is no need to
do the following:

```jsx
// don't do this
<div className="app" dir="rtl">
  <div dir="rtl">
    <p dir="rtl">
      Some text <button dir="rtl">Button</button>
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```

The `dir` HTML attribute is the recommended way to change directionality, but note
that this attribute is not supported in Internet Explorer.

### `direction` CSS rule

Another option to change text and UI directionality is through the CSS `direction`
rule. The default value for all elements is `direction: ltr;`. This rule is
supported by all major browsers and can target specific elements through CSS rules:

```css
.rightToLeft {
  direction: rtl;
}

.leftToRight {
  direction: ltr;
}
```

### Examples using `dir` and `direction`

For the following examples, the main element we are targeting is a div wrapper
that sets a 400px width container for a `SearchBar` component. Notice that in both
RTL examples (#2 and #3), it's not just the text that aligns right but the element
itself that aligns right. This is why using the CSS rule `text-align: right;` is
not the proper way to handle RTL languages since the UI needs to be mirrored (see above).

In both RTL (#2 and #3) examples, the directionality changes for the div wrapper
and there is no significant difference, but implementing both in a real application
won't hurt.

#1 - Left to right default

<Canvas>
  <DSProvider>
    <div style={{ width: "400px" }}>
      <SearchBar
        helperText="Use a keyword or phrase to search!"
        id="example1"
        isRequired
        textInputProps={{
          labelText: "Item Search",
          name: "textInputName",
          placeholder: "Item Search",
        }}
      />
    </div>
  </DSProvider>
</Canvas>

#2 - Right to left using `dir="rtl"`. Click on "Show code" in the following
block to see its code implementation.

<Canvas>
  <DSProvider>
    <div dir="rtl">
      <div style={{ width: "400px" }}>
        <SearchBar
          helperText="استخدم كلمة رئيسية أو عبارة للبحث!"
          id="example2"
          isRequired
          textInputProps={{
            labelText: "Item Search",
            name: "textInputName",
            placeholder: "Item Search",
          }}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  </DSProvider>
</Canvas>

#3 - Right to left using `direction: rtl;`. Click on "Show code" in the following
block to see its code implementation.

<Canvas>
  <DSProvider>
    <div style={{ direction: "rtl" }}>
      <div style={{ width: "400px" }}>
        <SearchBar
          helperText="استخدم كلمة رئيسية أو عبارة للبحث!"
          id="example3"
          isRequired
          textInputProps={{
            labelText: "Item Search",
            name: "textInputName",
            placeholder: "Item Search",
          }}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  </DSProvider>
</Canvas>

## Component Updates

You may have noticed in the above RTL examples that in the `Button` component
there is no space between the text and the icon. Although this may be difficult
to see in the Arabic language example, it's more noticeable in the English examples
below. The lack of space happens because the icon has a `margin-right` rule
which works well in the default LTR display but does not apply well in the RTL
display. No audit has been made to see what components need an update but in
general, specifying an equal margin or padding to both sides of an element may
help reduce any visual mistakes.

<Canvas>
  <DSProvider>
    <div style={{ display: "flex", flexDirection: "column" }}>
      <div style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        A regular button:
        <Button id="button-ex4" type="submit">
          <Icon name="search" size="small" align="left" />
          Search
        </Button>
        <div dir="rtl">
          An RTL button:
          <Button id="button-ex5" type="submit">
            <Icon name="search" size="small" align="left" />
            Search
          </Button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </DSProvider>
</Canvas>
