## Overview

Pages should be designed and built using a responsive grid system that
dynamically adjusts based on the screen size. Using a responsive grid system
helps to ensure consistent layouts across NYPL website.

The defined breakpoints will determine when default adjustments are applied to
the responsive grid system.

## Terminology

The following terms are used through the documentation, so it is important to
understand what they mean.

### Breakpoints & Breakpoint Ranges

A breakpoint defines a specific pixel value within the viewport width spectrum,
but when we talk about a breakpoint, we often think about it in terms of the
width range that is covered by the breakpoint (i.e. breakpoint range). With
that in mind, the NYPL Reservoir Design System will designate four actual
breakpoints and from that we will define five breakpoint ranges:

#### Breakpoints

- 480px
- 768px
- 1024px
- 1280px

#### Breakpoint Ranges

- Small mobile (base): less than 480px (see Appendix Section I: Small Mobile)
- Large mobile (s): 480px - 767px (see Appendix Section I: Large Mobile)
- Small tablet (m): 768px - 1023px (see Appendix Section I: Small Tablet)
- Large tablet (l): 1024px - 1279px (see Appendix Section I: Large Tablet)
- Desktop (xl): 1280px and greater (see Appendix Section I: Desktop)

### Grid Anatomy

The anatomy of a responsive grid is made up of elements that scale in a fluid
system as the device and viewport increases from small to large.

<SimpleGrid>
  <div>
    #### Columns

    There are 12 columns in a responsive grid system. Column widths change with the
    size of the grid.

    <Image src="/img/grid-columns.png" alt="Grid columns" mb="l" />

  </div>
  <div>
    #### Gutters

    Gutters are the gaps between the columns. Gutter widths are fixed values (16px,
    24px, etc.) based on breakpoints.

    <Image src="/img/grid-gutters.png" alt="Grid gutters" mb="l" />

  </div>
  <div>
    #### Margins

    Grid margins are the outer margins of the grid. They can be the same width as
    the gutters or greater.

    <Image src="/img/grid-margins.png" alt="Grid margin" mb="l" />

  </div>
</SimpleGrid>

### Perceived Columns

Often, the underlying columns in the 12-column grid system are grouped to create
"perceived columns."

<SimpleGrid columns={4} mb="l">
  <div>
    #### One

    1 group of 12

    <Image
      src="/img/grid-perceived-columns-1.png"
      alt="One perceived column" />

  </div>
  <div>
    #### Two

    2 groups of 6

    <Image src="/img/grid-perceived-columns-2.png" alt="Two perceived columns" />

  </div>
  <div>
    #### Three

    3 groups of 4

    <Image src="/img/grid-perceived-columns-3.png" alt="Three perceived columns" />

  </div>
  <div>
    #### Four

    4 groups of 3

    <Image src="/img/grid-perceived-columns-4.png" alt="Four perceived columns" />

  </div>
</SimpleGrid>

### Small Mobile

The small mobile breakpoint range includes viewport widths from 0 - 479px.

The page layout for the small mobile breakpoint range should use one column (1
group of 12 columns) and the Card component should always use the "column"
variant (vertical).

- Columns: 12
- Gutters: 1rem (16px)
- Margins: 1rem (16px)
- Perceived Columns: 1

### Large Mobile

The large mobile breakpoint range includes viewport widths from 480 - 767px.

The page layout for the large mobile breakpoint range can use one (1 group of 12
columns) or two columns (2 groups of 6 columns).

The "row" variant (horizontal) of the Card component should be
displayed in a single column and the "column" variant (vertical) should be
displayed using two columns.

- Columns: 12
- Gutters: 1rem (16px)
- Margins: 1rem (16px)
- Perceived Columns: 1 or 2

### Small Tablet

The small tablet breakpoint range includes viewport widths from 768px - 1023px.

The page layout for the small tablet breakpoint range should be presented as one
(1 group of 12 columns), two (2 groups of 6 columns), or three columns (3 groups
of 4 columns).

- Columns: 12
- Gutters: 1.5rem (24px)
- Margins: 1.5rem (24px)
- Perceived Columns: 1, 2, or 3

### Large Tablet

The large tablet breakpoint range includes viewport widths from 1024px - 1279px.

The page layout for the large tablet breakpoint range should be presented as one
(1 group of 12 columns), two (2 groups of 6 columns), three columns (3 groups of
4 columns), or four columns (4 groups of 3 columns). This is the same
recommendation as the desktop breakpoint range.

- Columns: 12
- Gutters: 1.5rem (24px)
- Margins: 1.5rem (24px)
- Perceived Columns: 1, 2, 3, or 4

### Desktop

The desktop breakpoint range includes viewports with widths 1280px and greater.

The page layout for the desktop breakpoint range should be presented as one (1
group of 12 columns), two (2 groups of 6 columns), three columns (3 groups of 4
columns), or four columns (4 groups of 3 columns). This is the same
recommendation as the large tablet breakpoint range.

- Columns: 12
- Gutters: 2rem (32px)
- Margins: 1rem (16px)
- Perceived Columns: 1, 2, 3, or 4

## Best Practices and Recommendations

### General

Columns and gutters scale in a fluid system as the device and viewport increases
from small to large.

Use white space created by the grid system &ndash; too much dense information can be
disorienting and overwhelming.

Avoid breaking alignment or slightly oversizing a container to stick out for
visual interest or to add emphasis

Create relationships and hierarchy between content elements by using the margins
and gutters in the grid shared by the page layout

Each breakpoint range has a recommended "perceived columns" value. This is the
recommended number of columns that should be used for a card grid. The card
variant (row vs. column) will determine how the cards are situated in the card
grid.

Avoid cramming content into small column widths. Based on the NYPL typography
recommendations, the width of a text block should be at least 300px. That being
said, some viewport width edge cases will fall below the 300px width
recommendation and that is okay.

### Mobile First

Begin designing with the smallest viewport width (one column) for small devices
like a phone.

Complete and optimize the layout for each successive viewport width.

Inspect responsive displays in between each breakpoint for how content responds
across the fluid spectrum.
