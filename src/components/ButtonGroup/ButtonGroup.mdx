## Overview

<Description of={ButtonGroupStories} />

Note: The `ButtonGroup` component does not come from Chakra because we want to
display the `Button`s in a column layout as an option, as well as control the
width.

## Component Props

<Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.WithControls} />

<ArgTypes of={ButtonGroupStories.WithControls} />

## Accessibility

This component is a wrapper around the `Button` component. For accessibility
information on the `Button` component, see the [Button
Accessibility](https://nypl.github.io/nypl-design-system/reservoir/v1/?path=/docs/components-form-elements-button--button-with-controls#accessibility)
documentation.

## Button Width

The `buttonWidth` prop can be used to set the width of the internal `Button`
components. The default value is `default` and it sets the width to
`"fit-content"` so the buttons will expand to its content. The `"full"` value
will set the width to the parent's width.

<Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.Width} />

## Layout

The `layout` prop can be used to set the layout to either `row` or `column`.

<Canvas of={ButtonGroupStories.Layout} />

## Disabled

The `isDisabled` prop can be used to disable all the `Button` children at once.
Individual `Button`s can still be disabled with their own `isDisabled` prop.

<Canvas name="isDisabled" of={ButtonGroupStories.Disabled} />
