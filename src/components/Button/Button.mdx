## Overview

<Description of={ButtonStories} />

Update the `buttonType` in the Controls section to see the types of buttons
that can be rendered.

- `"primary"` is used for actions that move the user forward. This is the default.
- `"secondary"` is used for actions that move the user back, such as cancellations.
- `"text"` is used for equally weighted actions in a text based list.
- `"callout"` is used for call to action text such as "Donate".
- `"noBrand"` is a variant used when there is no brand and will display the
  background color as black.
- `"pill"` is used for equally weighted actions within cards and always in a set.
- `"link"` has been deprecated and should not be used.

When one and only one `Icon` component is passed inside a `Button` component with
no text, it will automatically be configured to use the `"iconOnly"` type.

## Component Props

## Accessibility

The Reservoir `Button` component renders an HTML `<button>` element that is
accessible. `Button`s should be used to perform user actions or submit forms,
never to link and go to another page. For `Button`s without text and only an
icon, make sure to pass an `aria-label` value to the `Button`. `Button`s cannot
have images of text.

`Button`s can be rendered in three sizes through the `size` prop: `"small"`,
`"medium"`, and `"large"`. The default size is `"medium"`. Even though the `"small"`
size is available, we recommend to use the `"medium"` and `"large"` sizes.

The `Button` component also has a `screenreaderOnlyText` prop that can be used to
add additional text to the component that is only visible to screen readers. This
can be used to provide additional context to the `Button` when the text is short,
such as visible "Read more..." text.

## Button Groups

Primary and secondary buttons should be grouped like in the following example.
The `ButtonGroup` component should be used to wrap the `Button` component.

## With Icons

The `Icon` component collaborates great with the `Button` component. Check out
[`src/components/Icons/Icon.tsx`](https://github.com/NYPL/nypl-design-system/blob/development/src/components/Icons/Icon.tsx)
to see the full list of icon names that can be rendered.

The icon can be placed to the left or the right of the button text.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.TextWithIcon} />

Text in a button is optional if an icon is rendered, but make sure that there
is an `aria-label` passed to the `Button` component `aria-label="Previous"`.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.IconOnly} />

## Patterns

Buttons are blue by default but should be red when it is intended to be used as
a call out. The "Back to Top" button must be of `buttonType="secondary"` and
must include an up arrow icon on the right side.

## Other Examples

The variations modified by the `buttonType` prop:

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.ButtonTypes} />

Modifying the `isDisabled` prop:

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.DisabledButtons} />

## Sizes

Update the size of the `Button` component with the `size` prop and values:
`"small"`, `"medium"`, `"large"`. The default size is `"medium"`.
