# Autosuggest

The Reservoir Design System (DS) does not have its own `Autosuggest` component. Instead,
we are currently using the
[react-autosuggest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-autosuggest) package.
We recommend using this package in your application and wrapping it in a [custom
component](#code-implementation). The Reservoir Design System (DS) does have custom
styling that targets the classes from the `react-autosuggest` package, so the look
and feel will be consistent.

In the following previews, you'll notice that there is a lot of white space underneath
every input element. Since the suggestion dropdown will appear on top of page content,
we've added a min-height to make it easier to see the dropdown. This is for demonstration
purposes only and you will not need to do this in your application.

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story name="Basic" story={stories.AutosuggestLibrary} />
</Canvas>

## With custom icons

You can customize how suggestions appear by updating what the
`renderSuggestion` function returns. In the following example, an `Icon`
component is added to render a checkmark after each suggestion. View it by
typing "c" or "tr" in the following input.

```jsx
const renderSuggestion = (suggestion) => (
  <span>
    {suggestion}
    <Icon name="check" />
  </span>
);
```

<Story name="With custom icons" story={stories.AutosuggestFish} />

## Code Implementation

In order to use the `Autosuggest` component, we suggest wrapping it a custom
component that stores state. State is needed to keep track of all the
suggestions and of the current input value. The custom component returns the
`Autosuggest` component with the following suggested props:

```
<Autosuggest
  suggestions={suggestions}
  onSuggestionsFetchRequested={onSuggestionsFetchRequested}
  onSuggestionsClearRequested={onSuggestionsClearRequested}
  getSuggestionValue={getSuggestionValue}
  renderSuggestion={renderSuggestion}
  inputProps={inputProps}
  renderInputComponent={renderInputComponent}
/>
```

| prop                          | notes                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `suggestions`                 | The array of suggestions to use based on the component's state. An example can be using `const [suggestions, setSuggestions] = useState([]);` |
| `onSuggestionsFetchRequested` | Function that Autosuggest will call every time suggestions need to be updated.                                                                |
| `onSuggestionsClearRequested` | Function to clear out all current suggestions.                                                                                                |
| `getSuggestionValue`          | A suggestion can be a string or an object. If it is an object, this function tells it what property to use in the object.                     |
| `renderSuggestion`            | This function controls the output of each suggestion.                                                                                         |
| `inputProps`                  | An object with props for the `input` component.                                                                                               |
| `renderInputComponent`        | This function allows overriding the `input` component as well as the structure with other components, such as `label`.                        |
