## Accessibility

Using the DS `Tabs` component renders HTML for button tabs and panels that are
associated with each other. In order to simplify the content and reduce cognitive
load for a user, we recommend to not use more than a six (6) button tabs and
panels. Likewise, button tab labels should be clear and concise. Do not use
icons for tab labels.

The `Tabs` component is fully accessible through keyboard usage. The initial focus
on the UI is set on the first tab. To move between tabs, use the left and right
key arrows. The `home` key can be used to navigate to the first tab and the `end`
key can be used to navigate to the last tab. To move from a tab to its panel,
use the `tab` key. Likewise, use the `tab + shift` key combination to move from
the panel to its tab. A user cannot navigate between panels; they must navigate
through the tabs.

This `Tabs` component is implemented with Chakra UI and this library handles the
appropriate `aria-selected` and `aria-controls` attributes for the tabs, the
related `aria-labelledby` and `id` attributes for the panels, and the `tablist`,
`tab`, and `tabpanel` roles for the relevant HTML elements.

### Mobile Carousel

When viewing the `Tabs` component on a narrow screen, an additional carousel
interface is wrapped around the button tabs. "Next" and "Previous" arrow buttons
slide the view of the tabs to the left and right, but all initial functionality
for the `Tabs` component doesn't change.

- [Chakra UI Tabs](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components/disclosure/tabs)

## Composing with a Data Object

_Note: this is the recommended approach._

We recommended passing in the data for the `Tabs` component through the `data`
prop. This allows the consumer to pass in well-formed data and always generate
the correct DOM.

Internally in the DS `Tabs` component:

- we map through the data array and generate the appropriate components needed
  for the layout.
- adds the carousel feature for the mobile view.

Note that HTML is allowed in the `content` property in each object as part of the
string or as straight HTML.

```jsx
import { Tabs } from "@nypl/design-system-react-components";

const animalCrossing = [
  {
    label: "Tom Nook",
    content: <p>Tom Nook, <b>known in Japan as Tanukichi</b>, is a ...,
  {
    label: "Isabelle",
    content: "Isabelle, known as Shizue in Japan, is a fictional ...",
  },
  {
    label: "K.K. Slider",
    content:
      "<p>Totakeke, more commonly known as <b>K.K. Slider or K.K.</b>, is ...",
  },
  {
    label: "Mr. Resetti",
    content:
      "<strong>Mr. Resetti</strong>, full name Sonny Resetti, is a ...",
  },
  {
    label: "Zucker",
    content:
      "<strong>Zucker</strong> is a lazy octopus villager who first ...",
  },
];

// ...
<Tabs tabsData={animalCrossing} />;
```

## Responsive Mobile Carousel

For both, the `tabsData` prop approach and the children component approach
(described below in this document), the mobile carousel feature is built. This
adds "previous" and "next" arrows in the tab list for users to scroll through
all the tabs while the panel stays static.

Note that for the children component approach, we expect a `TabList` component
to be passed or else the mobile carousel will _not_ be built. More on this in
the [With Children Components](#with-children-components) section.

To view and test this in Storybook, go to the "Canvas" tab and change the
viewport in the Storybook toolbar at the top of the page.

## With Callback Event Function

If you need to keep track of the index of current tab that was selected, pass
an `onChange` event handler to the `onChange` prop. This will return the index
(0-based) of the tab selected.

```jsx
export const onChange = (value) => {
  window.alert(`Tab index selected was ${value}`);
};

// ...
<Tabs tabsData={animalCrossing} onChange={onChange} />;
```

export const onChange = (value) => {
  window.alert(`Tab index selected was ${value}`);
};

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With Callback Event Function">
    <Tabs tabsData={animalCrossing} onChange={onChange} />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## With URL Hash Option

In some situations, each selected tab should update the URL with a hash value.
To enable this, set the `useHash` prop to true.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With URL Hash Option">
    <Tabs tabsData={animalCrossing} useHash={true} />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## With Children Components

_Note: not recommended but available._

There are five components that make up the Design System `Tabs` component:
`Tabs`, `TabList`, `Tab`, `TabPanels`, `TabPanel`. The general layout is always
the same such that the `Tabs` component has `TabList` and `TabPanels` as children.

`TabList` only takes `Tab` components as children and `TabPanels` only take
`TabPanel` as children. While you can compose the DS `Tabs` components with these
available components, you will probably have to iterate or map through an array
to get the desired outcome. The DS `Tabs` component does this internally for
you so this should be a last resort option.

Make sure that:

- all five components are imported to use this approach.
- the structure follows the example below for the mobile carousel to render properly.

```jsx
import {
  Tabs,
  TabList,
  Tab,
  TabPanels,
  TabPanel,
} from "@nypl/design-system-react-components";
```
