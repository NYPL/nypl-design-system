## Composing with a Data Object

_Note: this is the recommended approach._

We recommended passing in the data for the `Tabs` component through the `data`
prop. This allows the consumer to pass in well-formed data and always generate
the correct DOM. Internally in the DS `Tabs` component, we map through the data
array and generate the appropriate components needed for the layout.

```jsx
import { Tabs } from "@nypl/design-system-react-components";

const animalCrossing = [
  {
    label: "Tom Nook",
    content: "Tom Nook, known in Japan as Tanukichi, is a fictional ...",
  },
  {
    label: "Isabelle",
    content: "Isabelle, known as Shizue in Japan, is a fictional ...",
  },
  {
    label: "K.K. Slider",
    content: "Totakeke, more commonly known as K.K. Slider or K.K., is a ...",
  },
];

// ...
<Tabs data={animalCrossing} />;
```

## With Callback Event Function

If you need to keep track of the index of current tab that was selected, pass
an `onClick` event handler to the `tabsOnClick` prop. This will return the index
(0-based) of the tab selected.

```jsx
export const tabsOnClick = (value) => {
  window.alert(`Tab index selected was ${value}`);
};

// ...
<Tabs data={animalCrossing} tabsOnClick={tabsOnClick} />;
```

export const tabsOnClick = (value) => {
  window.alert(`Tab index selected was ${value}`);
};

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With Callback Event Function">
    <Tabs data={animalCrossing} tabsOnClick={tabsOnClick} />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## With URL Hash Option

In some situations, each selected tab should update the URL with a hash value.
To enable this, set the `useHash` prop to true.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With URL Hash Option">
    <Tabs data={animalCrossing} useHash={true} />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## With Children Components

_Note: not recommended but available._

There are five components that make up the Design System `Tabs` component:
`Tabs`, `TabList`, `Tab`, `TabPanels`, `TabPanel`. The general layout is always
the same such that the `Tabs` component has `TabList` and `TabPanels` as children.

`TabList` only takes `Tab` components as children and `TabPanels` only take
`TabPanel` as children. While you can compose the DS `Tabs` components with these
available components, you will probably have to iterate or map through an array
to get the desired outcome. The DS `Tabs` component does this internally for
you so this should be a last resort option.

Make sure all five components are imported to use this approach.

```jsx
import {
  Tabs,
  TabList,
  Tab,
  TabPanels,
  TabPanel,
} from "@nypl/design-system-react-components";
```

<Canvas>
  <Story name="With Children Components">
    <Tabs>
      <TabList>
        <Tab>Tom Nook</Tab>
        <Tab>Isabelle</Tab>
        <Tab>K.K. Slider</Tab>
      </TabList>
      <TabPanels>
        <TabPanel>
          Tom Nook, known in Japan as Tanukichi, is a fictional character in the
          Animal Crossing series who operates the village store.

        <TabPanel>
          Isabelle, known as Shizue in Japan, is a fictional character from the
          Animal Crossing series of video games. She is a kindly Shih Tzu that
          debuted in the 2012 release Animal Crossing: New Leaf, where she
          serves as the secretary to the player character.

        <TabPanel>
          Totakeke, more commonly known as K.K. Slider or K.K., is a fictional
