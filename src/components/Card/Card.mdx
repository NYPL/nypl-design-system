## Overview

<Description of={CardStories} />

The `Card` component is viewed as a contained, stand-alone element. It is highly
configurable and composable. It can be shown with or without an image and the
content area is composed using Card-specific child components: `CardHeading`,
`CardActions` and `CardContent`. These child components can be arranged in any
order and each child component may be used multiple times within the content
area. Although a `Card` is a self-contained unit, `Card` components are often
grouped together and displayed in some type of grid layout.

Note: all of the examples have images with the `isLazy` set to true.

### CardHeading

The `CardHeading` component mirrors the standard Reservoir Design System (DS)
`Heading` component and accepts the [same props](../?path=/story/components-typography-styles-heading--with-controls).

### CardActions

The `CardActions` component is used to display "call to action" (CTA) buttons
and links for the card. The DS `Button` and `Link` components should be passed
as children into the `CardActions` component.

Set the `isAlignedRightActions` prop to true in the `Card` component to align the
`CardActions` to the right of the the main content area. This is only applicable
in the row layout of the `Card` component.

### CardContent

The `CardContent` component should be used to display all content other than
headings and CTAs.

### CardImage

The `CardImage` component is _not_ exported and is used internally only in the
`Card` component. It is a convenience component that mirrors the standard DS
`Image` component. This means that the `CardImage` component accepts the same
props as the `Image` component, in addition to the `isAtEnd` prop.

Developers do _not_ need to implement this component. Instead, it will be
rendered in the `Card` component through its `imageProps` prop.

<Source
  code={`
<Card
  imageProps={{
    alt: "Alt text",
    aspectRatio: "twoByOne",
    caption: "caption text",
    credit: "credit text",
    isAtEnd: true,
    isLazy: true,
    size: "medium",
    src: "//loremflickr.com/400/200/new+york+public+library",
  }}
  {...otherCardProps}
>
  <CardHeading level="h3" id="heading-id">
    Heading Text
  </CardHeading>
  <CardContent>
    Praesent commodo cursus magna, vel scelerisque nisl consectetur et.
    Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis. Cras justo odio, dapibus ac
    facilisis in, egestas eget quam.
  </CardContent>
</Card>
`}
  language="jsx"
/>

## Accessibility

### Headings

In general, headings from `h1` through `h6` must be in sequential order in the
DOM tree. Rendering an `h4` following an `h2` will throw an accessibility error.
Therefore, when adding `CardHeading` components, make sure to add them in
sequential order with the proper `level` prop.

<Source
  code={`
// Correct

<CardHeading level="h3" id="headingthree">
  Heading level three
</CardHeading>
<CardHeading level="h4" id="headingfour">
  Heading level four
</CardHeading>

// Incorrect

<CardHeading level="h2" id="headingtwo">
  Heading level Two
</CardHeading>
<CardHeading level="h4" id="headingfour">
  Heading level four
</CardHeading>
`} language="jsx" />

### Full-Click Functionality

Passing in a URL in the `mainActionLink` prop will make the entire `Card`
clickable. Other links in the `CardActions` component can still be accessed by
tabbing through and pressing "enter" or by clicking as you normally would on a
link.

## Image Position

By default, the image is always the first element within a `Card`. This means
the image is at the top of a `Card` with a column layout and on the left side of
a `Card` with a row layout. However, you can use the `imageProps.isAtEnd` boolean
prop to override the default placement and move the image to the last element
within a `Card`.

### Column Cards

<Canvas of={CardStories.ImagePositionColumnCards} />

### Row Cards

<Canvas of={CardStories.ImagePositionRowCards} />

## Image Size

By default, the image width is `100%` for a `Card` with a column layout and
`225px` for a `Card` with a row layout. However, you can use the `imageProps.size`
prop to override the default width.

### Column Cards

### Row Cards

## Custom Image Component

Instead of passing a path for the `imageProps.src` prop, you can pass a custom
image component in using the `imageProps.component` prop.

<Canvas of={CardStories.CustomImageComponent} />

## Fallback Image

Following the same pattern as the `Image` component, the `Card` component can
also render a fallback image when the main image fails to load. Set a fallback
image source through the `fallbackSrc` property in the `imageProps` prop. If an
_additional_ action needs to be performed when the fallback image is
loaded, pass a callback function to the `onError` property.

For more details, see the [Image component documentation](./?path=/docs/components-media-icons-image--docs#fallback-image).

Note that the following example renders a fallback image used in
Digital Collections and is not from `loremflickr`. The code snippet below is
a general example.

<Source
  code={`
<Card
  imageProps={{
    alt: "Alt text",
    fallbackSrc="https://loremflickr.com/540/420/cat"
    onError: (_event) => console.log("Card fallback image loaded"),
    src: "some-broken-image-url",
  }}
>
  // ...
</Card>
  `}
  language="jsx"
/>

<Canvas of={CardStories.FallbackImage} />

## Card with Link Heading

The `CardHeading` component works just like the DS `Heading` component. This
means that a URL can be passed in the `url` prop for `CardHeading` or a `Link`
component can be used as a child. Click on "Show code" in the example below to
see both patterns.

<Canvas of={CardStories.HeadingAsLink} />

## Card With Full-Click Functionality

To enable the full-click functionality in the `Card` component, pass a URL in
the `mainActionLink` prop. This will make the entire `Card` component clickable.
If the `Card` has action links or buttons, they can still be accessed by tabbing
through the `Card` and pressing `enter` or clicking like a regular link.

Internally, if multiple `CardHeading` components are passed, only the first one
will have the full-click link. This, however, does not affect the `Card` itself
from being having the full-click functionality.

<Canvas of={CardStories.FullClick} />

This example can be found in the [Turbine homepage](https://nypl-ds-test-app.vercel.app/).

<Canvas of={CardStories.CardFullClickTurbineExample} />

## Card With Full-Click Functionality and Tooltip

When the `Card` is fully clickable, an internal component wraps everything in a link, which in turn overrides the pointer events that trigger a `Tooltip`.

If you need a tooltip within a clickable `Card`, wrap the entire `Card` component inside the `Tooltip` and use the `placement` and `offset` props to move the `Tooltip` to display next to the intended reference.
Keep in mind that `offset` is static pixel values, so check where the `Tooltip` displays on all breakpoints. You may need to keep track of the offset values through state, and update them conditionally with the `useNYPLBreakpoints` hook.

<Canvas of={CardStories.FullClickWithTooltip} />

## Card with Right Side CardActions

It's possible to set only the `CardActions` component on the right side of the
main content area of the `Card`. This is possible only in the `layout="row"`
layout and through the `Card` component's `isAlignedRightActions` prop which
must be set to `true`.
