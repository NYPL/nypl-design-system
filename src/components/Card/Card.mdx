## Overview

<Description of={CardStories} />

The `Card` component is viewed as a contained, stand-alone element. It is highly
configurable and composable. It can be shown with or without an image and the
content area is composed using Card-specific child components: `CardHeading`,
`CardActions` and `CardContent`. These child components can be arranged in any
order and each child component may be used multiple times within the content
area. Although a `Card` is a self-contained unit, `Card` components are often
grouped together and displayed in some type of grid layout.

### CardHeading

The `CardHeading` component mirrors the standard Reservoir Design System (DS)
`Heading` component and accepts the [same props](../?path=/story/components-typography-styles-heading--with-controls).

### CardActions

The `CardActions` component is used to display "call to action" (CTA) buttons
and links for the card. The DS `Button` and `Link` components should be passed
as children into the `CardActions` component.

Set the `isAlignedRightActions` prop to true in the `Card` component to align the
`CardActions` to the right of the the main content area. This is only applicable
in the row layout of the `Card` component.

### CardContent

The `CardContent` component should be used to display all content other than
headings and CTAs.

## Accessibility

### Headings

In general, headings from `h1` through `h6` must be in sequential order in the
DOM tree. Rendering an `h4` following an `h2` will throw an accessibility error.
Therefore, when adding `CardHeading` components, make sure to add them in
sequential order with the proper `level` prop.

<Source
  code={`
// Correct

<CardHeading level="three" id="headingthree">
  Heading level three
</CardHeading>
<CardHeading level="four" id="headingfour">
  Heading level four
</CardHeading>

// Incorrect

<CardHeading level="two" id="headingtwo">
  Heading level Two
</CardHeading>
<CardHeading level="four" id="headingfour">
  Heading level four
</CardHeading>
`} language="jsx" />

### Full-Click Functionality

Passing in a URL in the `mainActionLink` prop will make the entire `Card`
clickable. Other links in the `CardActions` component can still be accessed by
tabbing through and pressing "enter" or by clicking as you normally would on a
link.

## Image Position

By default, the image is always the first element within a `Card`. This means
the image is at the top of a `Card` with a column layout and on the left side of
a `Card` with a row layout. However, you can use the `imageProps.isAtEnd` boolean prop
to override the default placement and move the image to the last element within
a `Card`.

### Column Cards

### Row Cards

## Image Size

By default, the image width is `100%` for a `Card` with a column layout and
`225px` for a `Card` with a row layout. However, you can use the `imageProps.size`
prop to override the default width.

### Row Cards

## Custom Image Component

Instead of passing a path for the `imageProps.src` prop, you can pass a custom
image component in using the `imageProps.component` prop.

## Card with Link Heading

The `CardHeading` component works just like the DS `Heading` component. This
means that a URL can be passed in the `url` prop for `CardHeading` or a `Link`
component can be used as a child. Click on "Show code" in the example below to
see both patterns.

<Canvas of={CardStories.HeadingAsLink} />

## Card With Full-Click Functionality

To enable the full-click functionality in the `Card` component, pass a URL in
the `mainActionLink` prop. This will make the entire `Card` component clickable.
If the `Card` has action links or buttons, they can still be accessed by tabbing
through the `Card` and pressing `enter` or clicking like a regular link.

Internally, if multiple `CardHeading` components are passed, only the first one
will have the full-click link. This, however, does not affect the `Card` itself
from being having the full-click functionality.

This example can be found in the [Turbine homepage](https://nypl-ds-test-app.vercel.app/).

## Card with Right Side CardActions

It's possible to set only the `CardActions` component on the right side of the
main content area of the `Card`. This is possible only in the `layout="row"`
layout and through the `Card` component's `isAlignedRightActions` prop which
must be set to `true`.
