## Overview

<Description of={Header} />

The `Header` component is meant to replicate (and eventually replace) the current
[NYPL Header](https://header.nypl.org/) which is used across various NYPL products,
with Design System technologies and components. It is a work in progress, and not
yet ready for use. What you see below is simply a static component with no functionality.
