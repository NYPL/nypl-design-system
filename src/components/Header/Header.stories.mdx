## Overview

<Description of={Header} />

The `Header` component is meant to replicate (and eventually replace) the current
[NYPL Header package](https://github.com/NYPL/dgx-header-component/) which is used
across various NYPL digital products, with Reservoir Design System technologies
and components.

The `Header` component is a complete and complex component that fetches data
from different APIs, uses the DS' `SkipNavigation` component for webpage
accessibility, has static NYPL.org navigational links, a login form for patrons
to log into NYPL's [Catalog](https://browse.nypl.org/iii/encore/) and
[Research Catalog](https://www.nypl.org/research/research-catalog/), and a
search form for patrons to search the Catalog and across
[NYPL.org](https://www.nypl.org/).

## Component Props

<Canvas withToolbar>
  <Story name="Header" args={{ isProduction: true }}>
    {({ args }) => <Header {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Header" />

## Accessibility

The `Header` component contains multiple native HTML elements that work together
to make the component accessible. It contains:

- Skip navigation - More information about this feature in the following section.
- Notification `<aside>` HTML element - This element is rendered above the
  `<header>` element and is a landmark element that renders NYPL alert messages.
  This landmark cannot be nested within the `<header>` element so it is rendered
  above. More information can be found in the
  [Notification Accessibility](https://nypl.github.io/nypl-design-system/reservoir/v1/?path=/docs/components-feedback-notification--notification-with-controls#Accessibility)
  section.
- `<header>` HTML element - This landmark element denotes the top content section
  of the page. There should only be one main `<header>` element on the page as a
  child of the `<body>` element and using the `Header` component will ensure
  this landmark element is present.
- `<nav>` HTML elements - The `Header` component renders one (1) `<nav>` element
  in the mobile view and two (2) `<nav>` elements in the desktop view. Each `<nav>`
  element appropriately contains its own `aria-label` attribute to differentiate
  it from one another.
- Dropdowns focus features - Each dropdown button and menu combination uses a
  focus trap feature to appropriately tab through the contents in the menu that
  is opened.
- `<form>` HTML element - The `<form>` element is used in the search feature.

## Skip Navigation

The `Header` component implements the DS' own `SkipNavigation` component. More
information about the component can be found in the
[Storybook documentation](https://nypl.github.io/nypl-design-system/reservoir/v1/?path=/docs/components-navigation-skipnavigation--skip-navigation-with-controls)
and about why we should use in its
[accessibility guideline](https://nypl.github.io/nypl-design-system/reservoir/v1/?path=/docs/accessibility-guide-skip-navigation--page).

It is important to note that the `SkipNavigation` component expects that the page
it is on has a `main` HTML element with an `id` of `mainContent`. This allows
the first link in the skip navigation to function correctly.

The second link in the skip navigation points to
[NYPL's accessibility resource](https://www.nypl.org/accessibility).

## Catalogs Login

### Desktop

### Mobile

In the mobile view, the "login" feature can be seen when the user SVG icon dropdown
button is clicked. The user unfilled SVG icon signifies that the patron is not
logged in while the user filled SVG icon signifies that the patron is logged in.

When logged in, it will display the patron's name and an additional "logout" link.

## Search

There is a single search form in the `Header` component that can be used to
search in two separate resources. In the search form, the patron can choose
their preferred search location.

When looking for an item, such as book, ebook, DVD, etc, the best search location
is the Catalog. For example, the [Catalog search](https://browse.nypl.org/iii/encore/search/C__Scats__Orightresult__U?lang=eng&suite=def)
for items about cats. This returns books, microform format items, and DVDs
about cats.

When searching for general information about the Library, events, or locations,
the NYPL.org website is the best search location. For example, the
[NYPL.org search](https://www.nypl.org/search/cats?searched_from=header_search&timestamp=1658412778392)
for information about cats at NYPL. This returns blogs and cat related items
from the NYPL Shop.

### Mobile

In the mobile view, the patron needs to click on the search icon button for the
search form dropdown to appear. The search form will contain a single search
input field and two buttons, one for the Catalog and one for the NYPL.org website.
The expected behavior is for the user to fill out the form and click on a button
to search the appropriate resource.

### Desktop

In the desktop view, the patron needs to click on the "Search" button with the
search icon for the dropdown to appear. The search form will contain the single
search input field, two radio buttons to toggle between the Catalog and NYPL.org
website, and a search button. The expected behavior is for the user to fill out
the form, choose the appropriate resource, and click on the search button or
press enter to submit the form.

## Navigation

There are two main navigational lists in the `Header` component. The (1) first
contains:

- the login dropdown button
- a link to the NYPL [Locations page](https://www.nypl.org/locations)
- a link to the NYPL [Library card](https://www.nypl.org/library-card) information
- a link to NYPL's email subscription service
- a link to donate to NYPL
- a link to NYPL's Shop

The (2) second navigational list contains:

- a link to NYPL's [Books/Music/Movies](https://www.nypl.org/books-music-movies) page
- a link to NYPL's [Research](https://www.nypl.org/research) page
- a link to NYPL's [Education](https://www.nypl.org/education) page
- a link to NYPL's [Events](https://www.nypl.org/events) page
- a link to NYPL's [Connect](https://www.nypl.org/connect) page
- a link to NYPL's [Give](https://www.nypl.org/give) page
- a link to NYPL's [Get Help](https://www.nypl.org/get-help) page
- the search dropdown button

### Mobile

In the mobile view, the patron needs to click on the hamburger menu icon button
for the navigation dropdown to appear. This dropdown contains the (2) NYPL
website navigation links, and the first list of links (1) are now rendered
as buttons in a grid. The location link, however, is now part of the four
icon button links rendered with the locator SVG icon.

### Desktop

In the desktop view, the first set of links (1) appears horizontally at the top
while the second set of links (2) appears at the bottom of the `Header`.

## Header Login Timeout

There are occassions when a patron logs out from either the Catalog, the
Research Catalog, or the logout link in the `Header` component but there is a
mismatch where one or more services _thinks_ the patron is still logged in. In
order to avoid confusion, the `Header` component performs an extra step to log
the patron out completely.

NYPL's Encore Catalog does not provide a way to programmatically log out a
patron, such as through an API endpoint. Due to this limitation, there is a
current workaround for logging out a patron in the `Header` component.

When a patron logs into the Catalog or the Research Catalog, a 30 minute timer
will start in the `Header` component. Once this timer reaches 0, the Header will
insert an `iframe` HTML element into the `body` HTML element of the webpage.
This `iframe`'s `src` attribute is set to the necessary Encore Catalog logout
link.

## Google Analytics

Google will sunset Google Analytics (GA) in 2023, but the current NYPL Header
uses GA and therefore the DS `Header` component will continue to use GA until
GA is sunset. At that point, a new analytics system will be used.

The `Header` component takes two props that are used to configure GA:

- `isProduction`: a boolean that determines whether the `Header` is in
  production mode or not. If `true`, the production GA code is set and the
  `testMode` status for unit testing is set to `false`; if `false`, the
  development GA code is set and the `testMode` is set to `true`. This props is
  set to `true` by default.
- `gaOptions`: an object that contains the GA settings with the following
  properties:
  - `debug`: a boolean that determines whether to log GA debug messages to the
    console. This is set to `false` by default.
  - `standardImplementation`: a boolean to initialize GA with the standard
    implementation. This is `false` by default, but if your app uses the
    standard initialize GA code that is set in the HTML body element, then
    set this to `true`.
  - `testMode`: a boolean that determines whether to set GA to test mode to use
    its special API for unit testing GA calls through the `testModeAPI`
    property. `false` by default but set to `true` when running unit tests.
  - `titleCase`: a boolean that determines whether to use title case for the
    GA page title. By default, this is set to the opposite value of
    `isProduction`. For example, when `isProduction` is `true`, then `titleCase`
    is `false`. Since `isProduction` is `true` by default, `titleCase` is
    `false` by default.
