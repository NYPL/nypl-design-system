## Overview

<Description of={Header} />

The `Header` component is meant to replicate (and eventually replace) the current
[NYPL Header package](https://github.com/NYPL/dgx-header-component/) which is used
across various NYPL products, with Design System technologies and components. It
is a work in progress, and not yet ready for use. What you see below is simply a
static component with no functionality.
