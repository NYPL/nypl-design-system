## Overview

<Description of={Header} />

The `Header` component is meant to replicate (and eventually replace) the current
[NYPL Header package](https://github.com/NYPL/dgx-header-component/) which is used
across various NYPL products, with Design System technologies and components. It
is a work in progress, and not yet ready for use. What you see below is simply a
static component with no functionality.

## Google Analytics

Google will sunset Google Analytics (GA) in 2023, but the current NYPL Header
uses GA and therefore the DS `Header` component will continue to use GA until
GA is sunset.

The `Header` component takes two props that are used to configure GA:

- `isProduction`: a boolean that determines whether the `Header` is in
  production mode or not. This sets the production or development GA code. This
  also sets the GA "testMode" for unit testing, i.e. we want to set this to
  `true` for unit testing by setting `isProduction` to `false`.
- `gaOptions`: an object that contains the GA settings.
  - `debug`: a boolean that determines whether to log GA debug messages to the
    console. `false` by default.
  - `standardImplementation`: a boolean to initialize GA with the standard
    implementation. This is `false` by default, but if your app uses the
    standard initialize GA code that is set in the HTML body element, then
    set this to `true`.
  - `titleCase`: a boolean that determines whether to use title case for the
    GA page title. `false` by default.
  - `testMode`: a boolean that determines whether to set GA to test mode to use
    its special API for unit testing GA calls through the `testModeAPI`
    property. `false` by default but set to `true` when running unit tests.
