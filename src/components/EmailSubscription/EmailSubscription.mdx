## Overview

<Description of={EmailSubscriptionStories} />

An NYPL privacy policy link will render within every screen of the EmailSubscription
("form", "confirmation", and "error" ), and the link will open in a new tab.

**Note**: For the purposes of Storybook, only one (1) `EmailSubscription` component
example is rendered on the bottom right of this page. The `EmailSubscription` example
below alternately renders the "confirmation" and "error" screens on each form
submission. This is just to demonstrate the different states of the component.
In practice, the consuming app is responsible for handling the form submission.

## Accessibility

The `EmailSubscription` component is a complex component built from various Reservoir
DS and Chakra components. The two main components are the DS `Button` component
used to open Chakra's `Drawer` component.

When the primary button is clicked, the dialog opens and focus is set to the
first focusable element which is the "close" button that contains minus icon in
the header of the dialog. While opened, focus is trapped within the dialog until
it is closed either by clicking on the "close" or "Cancel" buttons, pressing the
"Escape" key, or by clicking outside of the dialog. When the `EmailSubscription`
component is closed, focus is set back to the primary button that opened the
dialog.

The markup of the `EmailSubscription` structurally matches the modal dialog pattern
that is implemented by Chakra's `Modal` and `Drawer` components. The container
has `role=”dialog”`, `aria-modal=”true”`, `tabindex={0}`, `aria-labelledby` that
references the title within the dialog, and `aria-describedby` that references a
descriptive piece of text within the dialog.

Within the `EmailSubscription` component, the radio input field is created from the DS
`RadioGroup` and `Radio` components, and input fields are created from the DS
`TextInput` component. Each of these components has their own accessibility
features documented in their respective Storybook pages.

When the form is submitted, focus is set to the confirmation message or the
error message if an error occurs.

Whereas the `EmailSubscription`'s primary button element is placed within the DOM
structure where it is rendered, the dialog DOM structure is appended to the end
of the DOM tree and it is done by Chakra.
