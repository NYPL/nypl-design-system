## Overview

<Description of={SkeletonLoaderStories} />

The `layout`, `width`, and placeholder elements within the `SkeletonLoader` can
be customized.

Please note that the initial rendering below has the `width` prop set to `300px`
to better view the example. The default value is `100%`.

## Accessibility

According to W3C's success criterion 2.2.2 for operable user interfaces:

> For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts
> automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in
> parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop,
> or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity
> where it is essential;

The `SkeletonLoader` component can be used as a placeholder for local content
that is loaded in parallel but it typically does not last more than five (5)
seconds. For the DS usage, this is purely a visual cue and should not be picked
up by screen readers.
