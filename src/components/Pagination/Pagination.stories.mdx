# Pagination

<Description of={Pagination} />
Pagination navigates between the pages of a multi-page application. It is commonly
in search results. Use controls in the Basic example to explore this component with
very many or very few pages.

Pagination uses anchor tags because it is navigating between URLs.

  <Story story={stories.paginationUrlHref} />

## Pagination with onClick

It is preferred to use pagination with `getPageHref` and that the URL is updated whenever a page is changed.
However, optional `onClick` is available in case URL updating is not desired.

  <Story story={stories.paginationOnClick} />
