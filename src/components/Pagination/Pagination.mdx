## Overview

<Description of={PaginationStories} />

The `Pagination` component helps navigate between pages of a multi-page
application. It is commonly used on a search results page. Update the `pageCount`
prop in the Controls to explore this component with many or few pages.

## Accessibility

Internally, the `Pagination` component is implemented with a `<nav>` element with
an `aria-label` attribute of `"Pagination"` and an unordered `<ul>` element. This
component uses anchor `<a>` tags because it is navigating between URLs. In the
"unchanging URL" variation, each anchor tag has an `href` attribute with a value
of `"#"`, because the URL is not changing.

## Pagination with URL Updates

In order to update the URL with a query parameter, the parent component must
declare and pass a `getPageHref` function to the `Pagination` component. This
function takes a `selectedPage` number argument for the selected page and it
should return a string with the desired URL that the pagination links should go
to. Note that this will refresh the browser on every click.

In the following example, the `getPageHref` function will compute a new URL that
has `&page=` as a URL query. In your own application this query parameter can be
named anything but you have to pick up the value in the wrapper component.

<Source
  code={`
// Example in a search results page.
const getPageHref = (selectedPage: number) => {
  // This should be updated for your router system, if any, including the
  // base or origin URL.
  return \`{location.origin}?q=celeste&page=\$\{selectedPage\}\`;
};
`}
  language="jsx"
/>

## Pagination with Unchanging URL

It is preferred to use the `Pagination` component with the `getPageHref`
function passed as a prop and that the URL is updated whenever a page is
changed. However, the optional `onPageChange` prop is available in case URL
updating is not desired.

In the following example, the `onPageChange` function gets the selected page as
its only function argument. This is computed internally in the `Pagination`
component through its own state.

<Source
  code={`
// Example in a search results page.
const onPageChange = (selectedPage: number) => {
  console.log(\`Current page: \$\{selectedPage\}\`);
  // Do what you need to with the \`currentPage\` value.
};
`}
  language="jsx"
/>

### Forcing a Page Change Programmatically

There may be circumstances when you want to programmatically force the page
number to change without the user explicitly requesting it (for example, if
you want a user to be brought back to page 1 after entering a new search term).
You can use the `currentPage` prop to do this. Note, the `currentPage` prop can
only be used with the client-side, unchanging URL version of the `Pagination`
component, and in combination with the `onPageChange` function.

The following example shows that the user can be brought to page 1 without
clicking on the `Pagination` component.
