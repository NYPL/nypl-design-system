The Filters component can come in Applied and Automatic

## Applied Filters

Applied filters are characterized by the presence of an "Apply" button.  
Search results are not updated until the "Apply" button is pressed.

### Wide

### Narrow

In a narrow view, pressing the "Apply" button updates the search results
and closes the filters modal

## Automatic Filters

Automatic filters are characterized by the absence of an "Apply" button.
When a selection is made, the search is applied automatically.

In the modal view, it is required to have language that informs the user that the search results have been updated.
