## Overview

<Description of={SimpleGridStories} />

The `SimpleGrid` component is used to render UI elements in a uniform grid
layout, with the column widths and grid spacing fixed throughout the grid.

The NYPL standards for the items per row in a grid is `3` for desktop, `2` for
tablet and `1` for mobile. By default, the `SimpleGrid` component uses these
standards and the `columns` prop is optional. If the `columns` prop is used, the
tablet breakpoint will be dropped and only the mobile breakpoint (1 item per
row) will be triggered.

## Accessibility

The CSS grid layout properties are used for the `SimpleGrid` component. We don't
recommend using property rules that change the visual order of elements on the
page that don't match with its DOM order. This is because a screenreader won't
pick up `SimpleGrid` CSS rules and will read the page in the expected DOM order
rather than the visual order.
