# Accordion

<Description of={Accordion} />

The Accordion component pushes existing content on the page down. The
implementation is built using basic input/label DOM elements and CSS.
Therefore, make sure to pass the `inputId` prop to associate the label with
the input element. If multiple Accordion components are used on a page, make
sure that each `inputId` is unique.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story
    name="Basic"
    args={{
      accordionLabel: "Click to expand",
      children: <ListStory {...ListStory.args} />,
      inputId: "accordionBtn",
    }}
  >
    {args => <Accordion {...args} />}
  </Story>
</Preview>

<ArgsTable story="Basic" />

## FAQ example

The Accordion component has an optional `modifiers` prop that has pre-styled
designs. For example, when building out FAQ-like pages, pass
`modifiers=["faq"]` into the Accordion component.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story story={stories.AccordionAsFAQSet} />
</Preview>

## Scrollable example

Use `modifiers=["fixed-height"]` when the Accordion must conform to the height of its parent.
Any content underneath the accordion will continue to be pushed down.

<Preview withToolbar>
  <Story story={stories.AccordionScroll} />
