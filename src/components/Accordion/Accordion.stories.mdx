<Description of={Accordion} />

The `Accordion` component displays a list of high-level options that can
expand/collapse to reveal associated sections of content. This component pushes
existing content on the page down. Each accordion item is self contained but
when multiple are rendered together, they render in a "FAQ" style. When multiple
accordions are rendered together, they can each open and close independent of
each other.

The only way to render an `Accordion` component is to pass in an array of objects
with `label` and `panel` properties for each accordion item. Note that you can
pass in a string or DOM elements into the `panel` property in each object. This
approach is needed because, internally, we deal with the logic to render the
necessary icon, Chakra components, and styles.
