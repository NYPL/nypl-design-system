## Overview

<Description of={Accordion} />

The `Accordion` component displays a list of high-level options that can
expand and collapse to reveal associated sections of content. This component
pushes existing content on the page down. Each accordion item is self contained,
but when the data for multiple accordions is passed in through the `accordionData`
prop, the `Accordion` components are grouped together and rendered under a single
element. When grouped like this, each `Accordion` component still opens and
closes independent from the others in the group.

The only way to render an `Accordion` component is to pass in an array of objects
with `label`, `panel`, and optional `accordionType` properties for each accordion item.
Note that you can pass in a string or DOM elements into the `panel` property in each
object. This approach is needed because, internally, we deal with the logic to render
the necessary icon, Chakra components, and styles. Additionally, the `accordionType`
prop can be used to change the accordion button's background color. It takes a value
of `"default"` for `"ui.white"`, `"warning"` for `"ui.status.primary"`, and
`"error"` for `"ui.status.secondary"`.

```jsx
const accordionData = [
  {
    accordionType: "default",
    label: "Tom Nook",
    panel: (
      <Card

## Accessibility

- Follows [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/accordion/)
  guidelines:
  - Use the `button` HTML element for screenreaders and keyboards.
  - Use the `aria-expanded` attribute to indicate whether the `Accordion` is
    expanded (`true`) or collapsed (`false`).
  - Use the `aria-controls` attribute to associate the control with the panel.
- Deviates from USWDS in that the user can open multiple panels. Opening one,
  does not collapse already expanded panel.
- The open and close icons are decorative (`aria-hidden` is `true`).
- Visible focus goes around full button and full button is clickable.
