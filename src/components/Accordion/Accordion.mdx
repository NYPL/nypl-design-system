## Overview

<Description of={AccordionStories} />

The `Accordion` component displays a list of high-level options that can
expand and collapse to reveal associated sections of content. This component
pushes existing content on the page down. Each accordion item is self contained,
but when the data for multiple accordions is passed in through the `accordionData`
prop, the `Accordion` components are grouped together and rendered under a single
element. When grouped like this, each `Accordion` component still opens and
closes independent from the others in the group.

The only way to render an `Accordion` component is to pass in an array of objects
with `label`, `panel`, and optional `accordionType` properties for each accordion item.
Note that you can pass in a string or DOM elements into the `panel` property in each
object. This approach is needed because, internally, we deal with the logic to render
the necessary icon, Chakra components, and styles.

The `accordionType` prop can be used to change the accordion button's background color.
It takes a value of `"default"` for `"ui.white"`, `"warning"` for `"ui.status.primary"`,
and `"error"` for `"ui.status.secondary"`. The optional `panelMaxHeight` prop determines
the maximum height of the `Accordion`'s panel when expanded. If the content within the
panel exceeds the `panelMaxHeight`, a scrollbar will appear.

## Accessibility

- Follows [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/accordion/)
  guidelines:
  - Use the `button` HTML element for screenreaders and keyboards.
  - Use the `aria-expanded` attribute to indicate whether the `Accordion` is
    expanded (`true`) or collapsed (`false`).
  - Use the `aria-controls` attribute to associate the control with the panel.
- Deviates from USWDS in that the user can open multiple panels. Opening one,
  does not collapse already expanded panel.
- The open and close icons are decorative (`aria-hidden` is `true`).
- Visible focus goes around full button and full button is clickable.

## FAQ Example

Building out FAQ-like accordions happens automatically when there are more than
one object in the array passed into the `accordionData` prop.

## Always Render the Accordion Content

By default, the content in an `Accordion` is only rendered when it is opened. When
it is closed, the content gets removed from the DOM. This is an intentional
optimization. However, there will be occasions when you want to always render the
content inside an `Accordion` whether it's opened or closed. Use the
`isAlwaysRendered` prop to always render the `Accordion`'s content.

In the following examples, the first `Accordion` has the default behavior where
the content is removed when it is closed. The second `Accordion` always renders
its content. This is important in this scenario because we want to keep the state
of the content when it is closed. Click on subjects inside both `Accordion`s and
toggle them closed and opened to see the difference.
