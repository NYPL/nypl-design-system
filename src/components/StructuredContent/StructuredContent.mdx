## Accessibility

The `StructuredContent` component is a structured container around a specific
set of content. While the main image can be controlled through the `imageProps`
prop, the content will not always be controlled. If the content that is being
passed is coming from a CMS, the content can contain any set of HTML elements that
are _not_ controlled through Reservoir DS components. While this component
attempts to style the added elements, we cannot guarantee that the content will
be accessible. Please review your content and make sure that:

- The content's font-size to be scaled to 200% without content overlapping.
- Any additional images have descriptive (but not too lengthy) alt text.
- Any additional heading levels should not be skipped. Meaning, a `<h2>` should
  not be followed by a `<h4>`.
- Any links or text with colors should have a 4.5:1 contrast ratio.
