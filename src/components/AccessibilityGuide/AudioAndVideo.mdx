## General Information

Audio and video content need to be made accessible for NYPL audiences.
Information conveyed solely through audio is not accessible to people
with hearing impairments. Information conveyed visually through video
is not accessible to people who are blind.

## Captions

Captions should be provided for any videos that also contain audio.
The captions provide a text alternative for the audio information for
anyone who cannot hear the content. Captions typically include any
dialogue, identify speakers, and include any sound effects. Captions
must be accurate, synchronized with the video, and use proper
punctuation and grammar. Unedited automatic captions are generally not
sufficient. Automated captions can be a useful starting point, but
should be edited for accuracy.

## Transcripts

Transcripts should be provided for any audio-only content, such as
podcasts. Transcripts should match the audio content exactly, plus
include any relevant cues for understanding, such as identifying speakers.
If the audio is the result of a scripted production, then the script
itself can serve as the transcript.

## Audio Description

Audio description involves adding additional audio explanation of important
visual information that is not already contained in the associated audio.
It benefits users who cannot see the video content and may not obtain all
the information conveyed in the video based solely on hearing the audio.
Audio description can be added within any existing pauses in audio, or if
necessary, by inserting pauses in the video to accommodate longer description.
This process is typically done by a qualified third-party description provider.

When audio description is needed, it is typically done as a separate audio
track or a second version of the video with that audio track substituted.

It is better to plan your video to not require audio description. By ensuring
that any visual information is also conveyed in the audio/narration, you can
avoid having to separately describe the video.
