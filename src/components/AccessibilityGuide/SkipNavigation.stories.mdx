## General Information

An application's "skip navigation link" is used to skip to the primary or main
content of a page. This link is located at the top of the page and is visually
hidden until a user focuses on the link. For most applications at NYPL, the
[NYPL Header](https://github.com/NYPL/dgx-header-component) is used and this
component already renders a skip navigation link.

The link must target an existing anchor on the page and is typically the `id`
`"#mainContent"` set on the `main` HTML element on the page. When using the
Reservoir's `SkipNav` and `TemplateAppContainer` components, this accessibility
combination is automatically handled.

The `SkipNav` component renders two links, the first being the main link pointing
to `"#mainContent"`. The `TemplateAppContainer` component renders as a `main`
HTML element with a default `id` of `"mainContent"`. While it's possible to
update the target of the skip link and the id of the `<main>` element, this is
not recommended.
