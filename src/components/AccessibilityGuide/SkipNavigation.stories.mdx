## General Information

An application's "skip navigation link" is used to skip to the primary or main
content of a page. This link is located at the top of the page and is usually
visually hidden until a user focuses on the link. For most applications at
NYPL, the [NYPL Header](https://github.com/NYPL/dgx-header-component) is used
and this component already renders a skip navigation link.

The link must target an existing anchor on the page and is typically the `id`
`"#mainContent"` set on the `main` HTML element on the page. While the DS does not
currently, as of `v0.25.13`, provide a skip navigation link, it does provide the
anchor element for the link through the `TemplateAppContainer` component.

The `TemplateAppContainer` component renders as a `main` HTML element with a
default `id` of `"mainContent"`. This should be used as the anchor element that
the skip navigation link points to.
