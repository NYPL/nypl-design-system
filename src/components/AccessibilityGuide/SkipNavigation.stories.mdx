## General Information

An application's "skip navigation" is used to skip to the primary or main
content of a page. This component usually contains one link that is located at
the top of the page and is visually hidden until a user focuses on the link.
In the case of NYPL applications, the skip navigation contains two links; the
first link points to the main content of the page and the second link points to
accessibility information on [NYPL.org/accessibility](https://nypl.org/accessibility).

In the Reservoir Design System (DS), the `SkipNavigation` component renders two
links.

The first link points to the `"#mainContent"` anchor which an NYPL page
is expected to have. The `TemplateAppContainer` component renders as a `main`
HTML element with a default `id` of `"mainContent"`. While it's possible to
update the target of the skip link and the id of the `<main>` element, this is
not recommended. When using the DS' `SkipNavigation` and `TemplateAppContainer`
components, this accessibility combination is automatically handled. When not
using the `TemplateAppContainer` component, make sure to render a `main` HTML
element with an `id` of `"mainContent"`.

The second link points to additional accessibility information on [NYPL.org/accessibility](https://nypl.org/accessibility).
