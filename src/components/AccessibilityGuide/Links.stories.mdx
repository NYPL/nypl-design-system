## General Information

There is no explicit rule in the accessibility space that dictates using
underlines to indicate a link. However, because the underline is
long-standing default treatment of links by browsers, along with a change in
color, it is arguably the most recognizable indicator of a link's presence on a
page. In cases where it is not visually desirable to use an underline, such as
when a large number of links within body text may negatively impact readability
or scanability, then other design choices can be used.

From an accessibility standpoint, the most important thing is the ability to
identify links and distinguish them from non-interactive content. This can be
done in ways other than using an underline.

Color can be used, though it cannot be the ONLY method of distinguishing a link
within a block of non-linked text. This comes from WCAG Success Criterion 1.4.1
Use of Color, which states "Color is not used as the only visual means of
conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or
distinguishing a visual element." (Level A)

As an example, if you have a link within a block of non-linked text, then you
could rely on contrast between the color of the link text and the color of the
non-linked text (this should be 3:1 - use the Contrast Triangle tool to check
your combinations), and add additional cues such as bolding, increasing the
font size, using a different font, etc. This can also be combined with
additional indicators that appear when tabbing or hovering over a link.
However, note that on touch-screen devices there is no such equivalent
mechanism to trigger that additional visual cue, so the default state should be
distinct enough to be relied on alone.

For links that occur outside the context of a block of non-linked text, then
again, other visual cues that serve as a call to action can be used, such as a
border, increased font size, bolding, change of background, adjacent icons to
indicate an action, etc. Links in a main navigation area, or in a common list
format are generally considered to be fine without an underline.
