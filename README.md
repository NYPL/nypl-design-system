## Contributing Quickstart

Follow these steps to setup a local installation of the project:

1. Clone the repo

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/NYPL/nypl-design-system.git
```

2. Install all the dependencies

```sh
$ npm install
```

3. Run the Storybook instance and view it at `http://localhost:9001`

```sh
$ npm start
```

You can now edit styles or templates in the `src` directory, and they will automatically re-build and update in the Storybook instance. Adding new stories or changing story names will require a page refresh.

Information about active maintainers, how we run reviews, and more can be found in our wiki page for [Contributing to the Design System](https://github.com/NYPL/nypl-design-system/wiki/Contributing-to-the-React-Library).

Follow the [contribution document](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to follow git branching convetions, component creation and update guidelines, testing methodoly, and documentation guidelines.

## Developing with NPM Link

To develop with a local version of the Design System:

1. In the Design System directory, run:

```sh
$ npm link
```

2. Go to the consuming application directory and run:

```sh
$ npm link @nypl/design-system-react-components
```

3. Go back to the Design System directory and run the following command. It allos the local Design System to be rebuilt and exported automatically:

```sh
$ npm run watch-webpack
```

### npm Unlink

To unlink the DS codebase:

1. Run `npm unlink` in the Design System directory.
2. Run `npm unlink --no-save @nypl/design-system-react-components` in the consuming application.

## Using the Design System in Your Product

To use the Design System in your project:

1. Install the DS:

```sh
$ npm install @nypl/design-system-react-components
```

2. Import the styles in your main css file

```css
@import "~@nypl/design-system-react-components/dist/styles.css";
```

3. Consult Storybook for the list of available components and props that they require.

Here's an example with the `Link` component:

```jsx
import { Link } from "@nypl/design-system-react-components";

function NewComponent(props) {
  return <Link href="https://www.hathitrust.org/">HathiTrust</Link>;
}
```

Sometimes you may have conflicts, perhaps with `React-Router`. In that case, you can alias your imports:

```jsx
import * as DS from "@nypl/design-system-react-components";
import { Link } from "react-router";

function NewComponent(props) {
  return (
    <DS.Link>
      <Link to="/license">public domain</Link>
    </DS.Link>
  );
}
```

Some CSS rules in the Design System, such as the universal focus styling and the box-model, are namespaced to the `.nypl-ds` class. To include those in your app, add `.nypl-ds` to whichever wrapper tag makes sense in your application (e.g., `<div class="app">` or `<div class="container">`).

```jsx
<div class="app nypl-ds">
  <!-- your code here -->
</div>
```

### NYPL DS, NYPL Header, and NYPL Footer

Please note that the NYPL Header and Footer should be _outside_ of the `.nypl-ds` wrapper class.

```jsx
<body>
  <NYPLHeader />

  <div class="app nypl-ds">
    <!-- your code here -->
  </div>

  <NYPLFooter />
</body>
```

## CDN

You can also use the Design System styles in your project through the `unpkg` CDN:

```jsx
<link href="https://unpkg.com/@nypl/design-system-react-components/dist/styles.css">
```

If you need to reference a particular version you can do do by including the version number in the URL:

```jsx
<link href="https://unpkg.com/@nypl/design-system-react-components@0.9.1/dist/styles.css">
```

You can check out a working Codepen with unpkg [here](https://codepen.io/edwinguzman/pen/ExmXGKx).

## Accessibility Product Requirements

The NYPL Design System provides accessible stories, but real live data can necessitate additional accessibility requirements beyond what we're committed to in our generic, extensible components. To ensure your products' final result is accessible, please adhere to the accessibility requirements put together by NYPL's accessibility coordinator on [Metronome](http://themetronome.co/).

NYPL's Metronome instance is currently password protected. For access to Metronome, please contact NYPL's UX team or Design System team.

## Storybook

The NYPL Design System leverages Storybook to document all the React components and style guidelines.

### Documentation Instances

There are currently two main instances of the NYPL Design System Storybook documentation. There are also "preview" sites that are used to quickly and easily view pull request changes.

Production

The production Storybook documentation is deployed to [Github Pages](https://nypl.github.io/nypl-design-system/storybook-static/?path=/story/introduction--page). This is the main instance we use to share the latest stable release of the NYPL Design System. This documentation site is deployed through [Github Actions](/.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml) only on merges to the `release` branch.

As of July, 2021, the Github Pages production site gets deployed every two weeks on the same schedule as npm releases.

Development

The development Storybook documentation is deployed to [Netlify](https://nypl-design-system-dev.netlify.app/?path=/story/introduction--page). This development site has all the working updates that get merged to the `development` branch. This means that this site is constantly being updated as pull requests are being merged in. This site is used to see the lastest changes during a working sprint before a production release is made.

Preview sites

Preview Storybook documentation sites are deployed to Netlify for every pull request. They follow a pattern such as `deploy-preview-[pr-number]--nypl-design-system-dev.netlify.app` where `[pr-number]` is the number of the pull request it is deploying. For example, for pull request #101, Netlify will deploy a "preview" site to `deploy-preview-101--nypl-design-system-dev.netlify.app`. Since these "preview" sites are brought up only for pull requests, this means that the URL varies and that those instances are eventually shut off. They are not meant to be used as long-term sites but rather for reviewing working changes within the team.

### React Component Documentation

When actively developing components or fixing bugs, make sure that the related stories are created or updated. This means updating the respective `[component-name].stories.tsx` or `[component-name].stories.mdx` files. For more information on writing stories, check out the [Anatomy of a Story](https://github.com/NYPL/nypl-design-system/wiki/Anatomy-of-a-Story) wiki page.

For stand-alone document pages in Storybook, you need to:

1. create the `[page-name].stories.mdx` file in `src/docs/`
2. add the file reference to the `.storybook/main.js` file in the `stories` array

### Static Build

There should be no need to run the static Storybook instance while actively developing -- it's used exclusively for building out the `gh-pages` environment and deploying it to [Github Pages](https://nypl.github.io/nypl-design-system/storybook-static/?path=/story/introduction--page). In the event that you do run the static Storybook npm script, run:

```sh
$ npm run build-storybook
```

You can then view `/storybook-static/index.html` in your browser. _Make sure not to commit this directory_.

## Typescript Usage

The NYPL Design System is built with Typescript. Using Typescript allows for us to create components with modern and best practices, as well as giving us type prop validation for free among other benefits.

_Note_: Currently, Typescript is not usable when creating Storybook documentation in MDX files.

### Enums

Some of the NYPL Design System React components have props that only accept a value from a specific set of values. The set of values are organized through a Typescript string `enum`. For example, the `Heading` component has an optional `displaySize` prop. Only values from the `HeadingDisplaySizes` string `enum` are allowed to be used.

Following this pattern (assuming that the consuming app developer is also using Typescript):

- allows component creators to map prop values to SCSS/CSS classes
- allows component creators to define specific values that can be used
- allows app developers to be explicit when implementing a DS component and passing prop values
- allows app developers to catch errors early in compilation time since Typescript throws an error if an unintended or wrong value was passed

Even with these benefits, using `type`s are preferred over using `enum`s. If we _have_ to use `enum`s, the minimum best practice we can follow is to declare them as string `enum`s. Regular enums evaluate to a 0-indexed based array of values which can have undesired consequences when they are evaluated as prop values.

#### HeadingDisplaySizes Example

The following is a full example of an `enum` variable used to declare the `displaySize` component prop.

```jsx
// A string enum
export enum HeadingDisplaySizes {
  Primary = "primary",
  Secondary = "secondary",
  Tertiary = "tertiary",
  Callout = "callout",
}
export interface HeadingProps {
  displaySize?: HeadingDisplaySizes;
  // more props...
}

export default function Heading(props: React.PropsWithChildren<HeadingProps>) {
  const { displaySize, modifiers, ...rest } = props;

  if (displaySize) {
    modifiers.push(displaySize);
  }
  // the rest of the component...
}
```

Component usage in a consuming application that uses Typescript:

```jsx
// No errors:
<Heading
  id="h1"
  level={1}
  text={"Heading with Secondary displaySize"}
  displaySize={HeadingDisplaySizes.Secondary}
/>

// This will throw an error. `HeadingDisplaySizes.Secondary` evaluates to
// "secondary" after the code compiles but we expect the explicit
// `HeadingDisplaySizes` enum to be used while developing.
<Heading
  id="h1"
  level={1}
  text={"Heading with Secondary displaySize"}
  displaySize="secondary"
/>
```

If the consuming application does not use Typescript, then the following won't throw an error. Also, because Typescript doesn't run in MDX files, the following will also not throw an error in MDX Storybook documentation files. Make sure to write documentation properly.

```jsx
<Heading
  id="h1"
  level={1}
  text={"Heading with Secondary displaySize"}
  displaySize="secondary"
/>
```

#### Converting to types

Another way the `displaySize` can be implemented is through a `type`. This gives us the same Typescript prop type validation but is less explicit. For the time being, we want to write explicit prop values to make it easier to debug on non-Typescript applications that import the NYPL Design System.

```jsx
export type HeadingDisplaySizes =
  | "primary"
  | "secondary"
  | "tertiary"
  | "callout";
```
